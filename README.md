# eosmicroloan

This project is designed to provide microloans. The users are either given cash or other items in person and they payback their loans with EOS. 

This provides the user in confidence that their loan balance is always available, it is not tampered with, and all transactions are publicly recorded on the block chain. 

The EOS-USD price is obtained from the following smart contracts:
